# ðŸ’« About Me

Hello! Iâ€™m a Computer Science student and tech entrepreneur passionate about building software that solves real-world problems. I see code not just as syntax, but as a tool for innovation, impact, and transformation. Whether it's optimizing backend systems, enhancing user experiences, or integrating modern infrastructure â€” my goal is to build products that matter.

As a founder and engineer, I combine technical execution with user-centric thinking and long-term vision. I believe great technology should not only be scalable and efficient, but also meaningful â€” empowering users, enabling businesses, and creating tangible value in everyday life.
